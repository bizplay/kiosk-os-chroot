# LOCALIZATION NOTE (firstLineMustBeCacheManifest): the associated cache

# the line number.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2): the associated cache
# manifest has "CACHE MANIFEST" on a line other than the first line.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where "CACHE MANIFEST" appears.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (asteriskInWrongSection2): the associated cache manifest
# has an asterisk (*) in a section other than the NETWORK section. Parameters:
# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.

# where this error occurs.
slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ wonaa prefix URI moƴƴuɗo to gorol %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): the associated cache manifest has
# a URI containing too many ../ operators. Too many of these operators mean
# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section containing more or less than the standard two URIs
# separated by a single space. Parameters: %S is the line number where this

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (asteriskInWrongSection2): the associated cache manifest
# has an asterisk (*) in a section other than the NETWORK section. Parameters:
# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.
asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %1$S section at line %2$S. If a line in the NETWORK section contains only a single asterisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated as if the URI was listed in the NETWORK section. Otherwise such URIs will be treated as unavailable. Other uses of the * character are prohibited.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2): the associated cache
# manifest has "CACHE MANIFEST" on a line other than the first line.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where "CACHE MANIFEST" appears.
cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2="CACHE MANIFEST" is only valid on the first line but was found at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackAsterisk2): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section that attempts to use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. In this
# section the URI is simply a path prefix. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.
fallbackAsterisk2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the FALLBACK section at line %S. URIs in the FALLBACK section simply need to match a prefix of the request URI.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section containing more or less than the standard two URIs
# separated by a single space. Parameters: %S is the line number where this
# error occurs.

# or "fast". Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
settingsBadValue=The SETTINGS section may only contain a single value, "prefer-online" or "fast" at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): the associated cache manifest has
# a URI containing too many ../ operators. Too many of these operators mean
# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
